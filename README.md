# Functional Annotation Tools 

## Intuition
We will be dividing functional annotation tools into clustering, homology-based, and ab
initio-based tools.

## TODO
1. Finalize/Add tools for groups defined in "Grouping Software"
2. Start looking at the tools for clustering (limit to 3)
3. Test tools against test files from Courtney
4. Pick tools for cluster (place in /home/projects/group-b/functional_annotation/tools/ directory)
